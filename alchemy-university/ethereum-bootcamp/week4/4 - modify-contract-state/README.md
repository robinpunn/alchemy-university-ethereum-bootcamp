## Hardhat Quick Guide: Modifying State Variables
- In this guide, we will set up a simple Hardhat project structure, add a contract with a state variable and a function to modify it. 
    - We will then write a quick test to make sure the function modifies the state variable as expected - let's get to it!
> Hardhat is one of the ultimate web3 development tools. üî• We are creating guides like this in order for you to get some practice using it! Master Hardhat, master web3 development!

### Step 1: Set Up Project Structure Using Hardhat
1. In a folder of your choice, run ``mkdir modify-contract-state && cd modify-contract-state``
1. Run ``npm init -y``
1. Run ``npm install --save-dev hardhat``
1. Run ``npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers``
1. Run ``npx hardhat`` to initiate the Hardhat development environment - it will bring up some yes/no options, use the arrow keys to toggle the options and select ``Create an empty hardhat.config.js``
1. Your project directory should now contain the following: ``node modules``, ``package.json``, ``package-lock.json`` and the empty ``hardhat.config.js`` you just created - rolling on!
1. Open your project's ``hardhat.config.js``, delete all of its contents and copy-paste the following:
```js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
};
```
**Make sure that the solidity compiler version in your project's hardhat-config.js is set to 0.8.4 so that it matches that of the following contract!**

### Step 2: Create Smart Contract
1. From your project root directory, run ``mkdir contracts && cd contracts``
1. Run ``touch ModifyVariable.sol`` (creates a new file called ``ModifyVariable.sol`` in the current directory) and open the newly-created contract file
1. Copy-paste the following:
```js
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract ModifyVariable {
  uint public x;

  constructor(uint _x) {
    x = _x;
  }

  function modifyToLeet() public {
    x = 1337;
  }

}
```
- We've implemented a very simple smart contract that contains one state variable ``x`` and a function ``modifyToLeet`` that, when called, changes the state of the variable to be ``1337``.
4. Go ahead and save your contract - feel free to add more functions!

### Step 3: Create Test
1. Make sure to go back to your project root directory by running ``cd`` back from the ``contracts`` directory
1. In your project root, run ``mkdir test`` to create a new ``/test`` directory that will contain all your testing files!
1. In the ``/test`` directory, create a file called ``sample-test.js`` and copy-paste the following into it:
```js
// import testing libraries: https://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/ 
const { expect, assert } = require("chai");

// the `describe` scope encapsulates an entire test called `TestModifyVariable`
// the `it` says the behavior that should be expected from the test
describe("TestModifyVariable", function () {
  it("should change x to 1337", async function () {
    // this line creates an ethers ContractFactory abstraction: https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/contract/contract-factory/
    const ModifyVariable = await ethers.getContractFactory("ModifyVariable");

    // we then use the ContractFactory object to deploy an instance of the contract
    const contract = await ModifyVariable.deploy(10);

    // wait for contract to be deployed and validated!
    await contract.deployed();

    // modify x from 10 to 1337 via this function!
    await contract.modifyToLeet();
    // getter for state variable x
    const newX = await contract.x();
    assert.equal(newX.toNumber(), 1337);
  });
});
```
- This test, when executed, will deploy a contract instance ``contract`` and set ``x`` (that instance's state variable) to ``10``. It then calls the ``modifyToLeet()`` function on the instance which prompts a change to the state variable to ``1337`` and then uses ``assert.equal()`` to verify the change was successful.
4. Go ahead and save the file - feel free to play around with the values and add more tests!

### Step 4: Run the Test
1. In your **project root folder**, run ``npx hardhat test``
> If you are still in /test in your terminal, just type in cd .. and that will push your directory one back! :)
2. Your terminal output should look something like this:
```bash
 Modify Variable
1337
    ‚úîÔ∏èshold change x to 1337 (562ms)
1 passing (566ms)
```
- You have successfully set up a whole project structure! With the help of Hardhat, you were able to test whether your functions modifying your smart contract's state variables were actually modified - nice job!

### Extra Challenges:
- Create a new type ``string`` state variable and modify it
- Change the constructor argument
- Add a new test
- Create a ``scripts`` directory, deploy your contract and change the contract state
