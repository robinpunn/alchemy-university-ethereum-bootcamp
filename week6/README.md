### Solidity Challenges
#### Solidity Practice
- We've covered some of the core data types, functions and structs in Solidity. Now it's time to practice and apply these concepts through code challenges!
- These challenges will help you practice:
    - sending and receiving ether in smart contracts via ``payable`` methods and the ``.call`` syntax
    - control flow in Solidity: loops, conditionals and revert statements
    - data structures you just learned: mappings, arrays and structs
    - using timestamps to enable functions after some time has passed
#### Need Help?
- If you get stuck be sure to check out some resources along the way!
- The Solidity Documentation: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/
    - **HINT**: *we recommend opening up the Solidity docs in a ***new tab*** so it's always handy! True devs live by documentation*
