### What is ENS?
- ENS stands for The Ethereum Name Service and it behaves very similar to how DNS behaves in the web2 space.
    - As we all know that Ethereum has long addresses which are hard to remember or type.
    - ENS solves this issue by translating these wallet addresses, hashes etc into readable domains which are then saved on Ethereum blockchain.
