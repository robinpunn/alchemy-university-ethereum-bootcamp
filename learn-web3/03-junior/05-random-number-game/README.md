# [Secure on-chain randomness using Chainlink VRFs](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/ethereum-developer-degree/junior/secure-on-chain-randomness-using-chainlink-vrfs/)

### What is an oracle?
- An oracle sends data from the outside world to a blockchain's smart contract and vice-versa.
- Smart contract can then use this data to make a decision and change its state.
- They act as bridges between blockchains and the external world.
- However it is important to note that the blockchain oracle is not itself the data source but its job is to query, verify and authenticate the outside data and then further pass it to the smart contract.

### This project uses Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to create random numbers
