# [Testing smart contracts on a local blockchain node using Hardhat](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/ethereum-developer-degree/junior/testing-smart-contracts-on-a-local-blockchain-node-using-hardhat/)

### Testing contracts on a local blockchain node
- This tutorial should familiarize you with starting a local blockchain using Hardhat, deploying a sample smart contract to the local blockchain and interacting with that blockchain with Metamask and Remix.

### Why local blockchain?
- It is very useful to run a local blockchain because testing becomes very fast and efficient.
    - It is only your machine which is running the blockchain and thus consensus is fast and you dont have to wait for other nodes to sync or validate.
    - You can also use many specialized modules specially built for local testing like Hardhat console.log which helps you to add printing inside your contract.
