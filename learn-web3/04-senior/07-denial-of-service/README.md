- A Denial of Service (DOS) attack is a type of attack that is designed to disable, shut down, or disrupt a network, website, or service.
    - Essentially it means that the attacker somehow can prevent regular users from accessing the network, website, or service therefore denying them service.
    - This is a very common attack which we all know about in web2 as well but today we will try to imitate a Denial of Service attack on a smart contract
