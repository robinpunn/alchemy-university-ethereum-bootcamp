# [Generating random numbers on-chain](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/ethereum-developer-degree/senior/generating-random-numbers-on-chain/)
- Randomness is a hard problem.
    - Computers run code that is written by programmers and follows a given sequence of steps.
    - As such, it is extremely hard to design an algorithm that will give you a 'random' number since that number must come from an algorithm that follows a certain sequence of steps. Now, of course, some functions are better than others.
- In this case, we will specifically look at why you cannot trust on-chain data as sources of randomness (and also why Chainlink VRF's, that we used in Junior, were created).
