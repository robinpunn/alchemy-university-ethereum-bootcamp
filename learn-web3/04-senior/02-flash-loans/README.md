### What are Flash Loans?
- You might be thinking: Is it some kind of loan?
    - Well, yes, it is.
    - It's a special type of loan where a borrower can borrow an asset as long as they return the borrowed amount and some interest before the end of the transaction.
    - Since the borrowed amount is returned back, with interest, in the same transaction, there is no possibility for anyone to run away with the borrowed money.
    - If the loan is not repaid in the same transaction, the transaction fails overall and is reverted.
