# [NEVER use tx.origin again](https://learnweb3.io/degrees/ethereum-developer-degree/senior/never-use-tx-origin-again/)

### tx.origin vs msg.sender
- ``tx.origin`` is a global variable which returns the address that created the original transaction.
    - It is kind of similar to ``msg.sender``, but with an important caveat.
    - We will learn how incorrect use of ``tx.origin`` could lead to security vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

### What is tx.origin?
- ``tx.origin`` is a global variable which returns the address of the account which sent the transaction.
    - Now you might be wondering then what is ``msg.sender`` ðŸ¤”.
    - The difference is that ``tx.origin`` refers to the original external account (which is the user) that started the transaction and ``msg.sender`` is the immediate account that called the function and it can be an external account or another contract calling the function.
- So for example, if ``User`` calls ``Contract A``, which then calls ``contract B`` within the same transaction, ``msg.sender`` will be equal to ``Contract A`` when checked from inside Contract B. However, ``tx.origin`` will be the ``User`` regardless of where you check it from.
