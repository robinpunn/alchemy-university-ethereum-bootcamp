# [Capture The Ether](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/)

---

### Capture the Ether using Hardat
- These challenges were deployed to the Ropsten testnet which is now deprecated
- However, the challenges can be completed using something like the Remix IDE
- Or we can use devlopment environments like Hardhat or Foundry
- This repo uses Hardhat.
- It has the contracts, deploy scripts, and tests needed to complete the challenges

#### Local Hardhat node
- The challenges were completed using a local node
- scripts were run with the command:
```
npx hardhat run --network localhost <script>
```
