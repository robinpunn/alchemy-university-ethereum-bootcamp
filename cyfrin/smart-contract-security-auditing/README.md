#### Tooling Prerequisites
[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)
    - chisel
    - cast
    - forge
- [Windows Users: WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
- AI Helpers
    - ChatGPT
    - Phind
- Forums & Resources
    - Ethereum Stack Exchange
    - Peeranha
    - Github Discussions

#### Solidity & Smart Contract Prerequisites
- Should be familiar with [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
	- Compile
	- Deploy locally and deploy to test net using inject provider

**Foundry**
- Use foundry to create a project
	- make a directory: `mkdir directory-name`
    - `forge init --no-git` (use `--no-git` to avoid issues when creating a project already within a repository... not needed if creating a fresh project)
- Should be able to understand the following smart contract:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Counter {
    uint256 public number;

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }
}
```

- Use `forge build` to compile

**Testing**
- We have our tests in the `test` folder
	- run tests with `forge test`

```solidity
function test_Increment() public {
	counter.increment();
	assertEq(counter.number(), 1);
}
```
- This is a regular test where we expect a certain value

```solidity
function testFuzz_SetNumber(uint256 x) public {
	counter.setNumber(x);
	assertEq(counter.number(), x);
}
```
- This is a fuzz test that will use a certain number random numbers based on how many runs we set

- `foundry.toml` has a link for more info: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/crates/config/README.md#all-options
```
[fuzz]
runs = 256
max_test_rejects = 65536
seed = '0x3e8'
dictionary_weight = 40
include_storage = true
include_push_bytes = true
```
- This is how we can change the number of fuzz runs, by adding it to `foundry.toml`
- run a single test: `forge test --mt testName`
